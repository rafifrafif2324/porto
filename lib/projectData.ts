    description:
      "Conducted sentiment analysis on social media posts related to IKN (Ibu Kota Nusantara) on platform X (formerly Twitter), incorporating buzzer/bot identification to enhance data reliability. Leveraged a hybrid approach combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to accurately predict text polarity scores and extract topic clusters. The analysis provided deeper insights into public discourse, engagement patterns, and the presence of coordinated opinion shaping behavior around the new capital development initiative.",
